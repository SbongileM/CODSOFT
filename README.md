This project aims to create a user-friendly interface for a To-Do application which
will help users organize their tasks efficiently. It allows the user to create, update
and track their To-Do lists.

2. Standard calculator
This project aims to create a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations using python.
The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation of choice, performs a 
calculation and then displays the result. Additional functionalities such as percentage, square 
root, square and parenthesis were added. The calculator can evaluate more than just two numbers.

on the home window. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
- Displays the user's choice and the computer's choice, and the result, whether 
the user wins, loses, or if it's a tie.

multiple rounds.
